\title{convolve a regressor with a normalized HRF with peak amplitude = 1.0}
\usage{
hrf_convolve_normalize(scans, times, durations, values, rt = 1,
  normeach = FALSE, rmzeros = TRUE, demean_events = TRUE,
  demean_convolved = FALSE, a1 = 6, a2 = 12, b1 = 0.9, b2 = 0.9,
  cc = 0.35)
}
\description{
extends fmri.stimulus by allowing for two normalization approaches (building on AFNI dmUBLOCK):
  1) pre-convolution HRF max=1.0 normalization of each stimulus regardless of duration: identical to dmUBLOCK(1)
  2) pre-convolution HRF max=1.0 normalization for long events (15+ sec) -- height of HRF is modulated by duration of event: identical to dmUBLOCK(0)
